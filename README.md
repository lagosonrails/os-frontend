The ATM locator Client is part of the open-source initiatives of the Lagos On Rails Community, which aims to:
* Provide an ease of access to ATMs around you
* Help reduce the bank charges incurred by using the ATM of other banks

To run the project locally, clone the repo, run `npm install` then run  `npm start`. You can add a `-s` flag to `npm start` so as to limit the logs in the terminal.
